# Vendor-Sales-Analysis-
This project analyzes vendor sales data to find low-turnover vendors, compare profit margins, and identify brands for promotions. Using data filtering, correlation heatmaps, and hypothesis testing, it offers actionable recommendations to diversify the vendor base and optimize inventory for improved profitability and efficiency.

Project Workflow
The project follows these simple steps:

Data Ingestion: The ingestion_db.py script pulls the initial data from a database.


Analysis: The EDA.ipynb and vendor perfomance analysis.ipynb notebooks are used to explore and analyze the data to find insights.

Data Export: The export_to_csv.ipynb notebook processes and saves this data into the vendor_sales_summary.csv file.
